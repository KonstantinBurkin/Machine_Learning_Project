# Sales forecasting

## Introduction
This is my Machine Learning project for MSU course "Machine learning for applied problems", Spring semester 2022.
Link to the course is [here](https://github.com/MSUcourses/Data-Analysis-with-Python/tree/main/Machine%20Learning). 
The resulting dataframe of this project was evaluated by supervisors using <a href="https://contest.yandex.ru/">Yandex.contest</a> platform.

## Assignment
Create predictions to evaluate the number of sales for next week of February. The next week of February was described by test dataframe, that contained information about the date, weather conditions, product types, stores, and their locations. The history of the sales for previous 7 months is available in the train dataframe. The predictions should be made with any kind of ML model. However, predictions should not exceed 4.1 points of mean absolute error metric.
